# Vue and Django
## Vue

use `npm install vue-cli` to install the command line interface for vue, which is useful for setting up what 
templates you want to use.

Then, in the directory you want vue to be in, run:
```
vue init 'choice-of-template' 'name-of-project'
```
The choice of templates are:

- webpack - A full-featured Webpack + vue-loader setup with hot reload, linting, testing & css extraction.

- webpack-simple - A simple Webpack + vue-loader setup for quick prototyping.

- browserify - A full-featured Browserify + vueify setup with hot-reload, linting & unit testing.

- browserify-simple - A simple Browserify + vueify setup for quick prototyping.

- pwa - PWA template for vue-cli based on the webpack template

- simple - The simplest possible Vue setup in a single HTML file

You can then follow the command prompts which allow you to set your project name, vue build etc.

The next steps are displayed in the terminal, but they are:
```
cd name-of-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
