# Useful Linux Commands
Load bash profile:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

- `source` runs the file

- `~/` means the users home directory (which is where the profile is kept)

- `.bash_profile` is the file that stores all the user config for the bash shell, and the full stop before it hides the file from common programs


You can edit the bash_profile in order to create alias':
`alias commandname='list of commands; separated by ;`
